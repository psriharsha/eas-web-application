<center><h1>Emergency Alarming System</h1></center>
<br /><br />This application is basically for the senior citizens who prefer to live independently, away from everyone. In case of emergency, it is very difficult to convey the situation and location of the senior citizens to some authority (Police) or the dearest people, even if their contact numbers are in the mobile phone. This idea made me to think of this project, which I call it as Emergency Alarming System.<br />
This application is for the android devices, which when installed, detects the motion of the device continuously and stores this data in the internet. This data can be viewed by the care givers at any time by logging into the web application. When an abnormal activity like sudden fall of the device is detected or if the senior citizen presses the panic button of the application, an immediate notification is sent to the care giver in the form of SMS and mail, so that they can act immediately and inquire about the senior person, if he/she is okay.
